# libpd-sys

[![Build Actions Status](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/actions)

Rust bindings for [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd).

This crate is not meant to be used directly, but rather as a dependency of [libpd-rs](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs).

## Contribute

I need help completing the Windows section of the build script.
Any contributions or PRs are more than welcome.
